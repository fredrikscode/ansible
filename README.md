### Description
The goal of this repository is to collect and maintain roles, playbooks and configurations related to Ansible that have been used in my environments and are spread out across repos.

"One repo to rule them all"

### Bugs, feature requests etc.
File them if you see fit and I'll investigate it.

### Sources
I'll try to mention sources for various non-std solutions if I remember to.
